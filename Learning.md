# To set up the backend for web site application, I have installed the following dependencies:

- **cors**: A package for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow resources to be shared between different origins.
- **dotenv**: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used for building the server and handling HTTP requests.
- **mongodb**: The official MongoDB driver for Node.js, used for interacting with MongoDB databases.
- **mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher-level abstraction for interacting with MongoDB.
- **multer**: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is used for file uploads.
