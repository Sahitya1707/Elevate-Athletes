# Folder structure for next js

# How do you handle the error in next js?

- **Custom 404 page** - The `not-found.js` file allows you to create a custom page to display when users attempt to access non-existent routes in your application.
- **Error Boundary for route segments** - The `error.js` file defines an error boundary component for a specific route segment. It catches unexpected errors and displays a fallback UI.
- **Error Boundaries - Global Error Handling** -
  Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors within their tree, preventing them from crashing the entire application.

# How do you approach for dark mode and light mode in tailwind?

- There are many options for this but I have opt for using the css variables that is using the `:root` element.
- At first you need to declare the root inside your `global.css` and put all you colors over there with proper naming.
- Create another :root with [class~="dark"] which will targets the root element if it has dark class.
- now you can define those colors in `tailwind.config.js`

# For the developer log in into the dashboard

- My approach for the login of the developer into the backend is that there should be super admin and admin and the credntials should already be defined so for this I will try to create a seeder functions where I can store that credentials.

# React redux in next js

- In Next.js 13, you cannot directly use React Redux in the root layout because Next.js renders components on the server by default. To use Reduxâ€™s <Provider>, which requires a client component, you need to create an additional layout designated as a client component. This layout, such as `AppLayout`, can then include the Redux <Provider> and pass children props to render your components properly.

# What is suspense in react?

- Suspense is a React feature that allows components to declaratively express that they are waiting for something to load. It provides a way to gracefully handle `asynchronous operations`, such as `data fetching` or `code splitting`, by `displaying a fallback UI` while the operation is in progress.

# Fast Reloading in next js

# What is color Mapping in tailwind css?

- Color mapping is a technique used to associate specific color names with their corresponding CSS variable values. This allows you to pass a simple string as a prop to your component and have it automatically use the correct CSS variable for styling.
