- **Custom 404 page** - The `not-found.js` file allows you to create a custom page to display when users attempt to access non-existent routes in your application.
- **Error Boundary for route segments** - The `error.js` file defines an error boundary component for a specific route segment. It catches unexpected errors and displays a fallback UI.

  Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors within their tree, preventing them from crashing the entire application.

# How do you approach for dark mode and light mode in taiwind?

- There are many options for this but I have opt for using the css variables that is using the `:root` element.
- At first you need to declare the root inside your `global.css` and put all you colors over there with proper naming.
- Create another :root with [class~="dark"] which will targets the root element if it has dark class.
- now you can define those colors in `tailwind.config.js`

It provides a way to gracefully handle `asynchronous operations`, such as `data fetching` or `code splitting`, by `displaying a fallback UI` while the operation is in progress.
